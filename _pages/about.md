My name is Siwen Ding, and I usually go by Sivan. 
I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Juan Bello](https://wp.nyu.edu/jpbello/) at 
the [Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/), New York University, in Brooklyn, NY. 
I am mesmerized by human perception and embodiment, especially auditory perception, 
and how we model them in machines. 
My research goal is to make machines that can understand, deconstruct, and create sound. 
I'm interested in exploring compositionality, disentanglement, and generalizability in audio representation learning.

Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://dolby.com/) in SF on spatial audio.
I earned my master's degree in data science from Columbia University, 
where I often found myself sneaking into the [Computer Music Center](https://cmc.music.columbia.edu/news-events) for some sound art. 
I hold a bachelor's degree in energy engineering (thermodynamics) at Wuhan University, China.
