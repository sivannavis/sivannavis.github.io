I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Juan Bello](https://wp.nyu.edu/jpbello/) at 
the [Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/), New York University, in Brooklyn, NY. 
I am mesmerized by human perception and embodiment, especially auditory perception, 
and how we model them in machines: machine listening and music information retrieval. 
My research goal is to make machines that can understand, deconstruct, and create sound. 
I'm interested in exploring compositionality, disentanglement, and generalizability in audio representation learning.

Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Dolby Laboratories](https://dolby.com/) with wonderful people in San Francisco on all the cool stuff about spatial audio. 
I earned my master's degree in data science from Columbia University in the City of New York, 
where I often found myself sneaking into the [Computer Music Center](https://cmc.music.columbia.edu/news-events) for some sound art. 
I hold a bachelor's degree in energy engineering (thermodynamics) at Wuhan University, China.

I make music and geek out on lots of things in my increasingly squeezed spare time, 
which you can learn more about on my "fun" website at [sivan.fun](https://www.sivan.fun).
